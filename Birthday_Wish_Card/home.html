        <p>Hey pillu,</p>
        <p>There is no gift or words that could truly express my love for you. I have a thousand kisses to offer, but that would not be enough. As long as I put a smile on your face and warmth in your heart, then my dreams have been attained. </p>
        <p>There are moments in life that you will never forget. Every moment I’m with you, I will never forget. Wishing you a birthday full of love and tender memories.</p>
        <p>Happy Birthday to my better half. You complete me in ways that I could have never imagined. Loving you has truly been the greatest adventure of a lifetime.
