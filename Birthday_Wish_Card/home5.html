        <p>Hey Jaan,</p>
        <p>I'm glad we made it to another year to celebrate your birthday together. Hand in hand, heart to heart, may our story be happy and never ending. On your birthday, I give you this promise to love and cherish you forever</p>
        <p>I will always honor and respect you for as long I live. May our friendship grow stronger and last a lifetime.</p>
        <p>You are truly unique in every way. No other lady could capture my heart the way you do. Maybe itâ€™s the special way you always know what to say or the way you make me laugh. Have a wonderful birthday. Thank you for being you.
        </p>
        <p>I Love you jaan &#10084</p>
